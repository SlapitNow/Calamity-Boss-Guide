* **Armor Sets:**

    * **Any class**: Victide, Aerospec.

* **Required Items**: Shadow Key.

* **Helpful Items:** Flipper Potions, Shine Potions, Glowsticks, Zen Potions, Any form of water breathing (Ocean Crest, Gills Potions, etc), Siren's Heart.

* **Accessible Layers**: 1-2.

* **What to do:**

   * During your first trip, your goal should just be to grab whatever you can from the shadow chests and leave after that.
   * Loot is randomized in the chests, so sometimes you may have to go deeper than you're supposed to to get what you want. If you haven’t gotten what you wanted - fishing in Sulphur Sea is still an option, you just need to have 80-120 fishing power to catch any chest loot (you won't get any weapons).
   * I would recommend to only use zen potions if you need to go really deep to get the weapon you want, but be careful because Zen potions have reduced effectiveness (10% as effective) while you’re in there. Again, you don’t need anything but the shadow chests for this visit, so just get them and go, don’t bother fighting anything unless it directly attempts to kill you.
   * Most Abyss enemies are passive anyways, so you can avoid them most of the time. 
   * You can mine abyss gravel if you have at least a Deathbringer/Nightmare pickaxe, so that should help you get around.
